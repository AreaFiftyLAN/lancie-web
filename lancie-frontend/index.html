        <h1>Area FiftyLAN</h1>
        <p>
          Area FiftyLAN is the annual gaming event held at the TU Delft. In
          March, more than 200 gamers will spend the weekend having a blast
          playing games together. It is organized by the study association of
          Applied Mathematics and Computer Science &amp; Engineering, W.I.S.V.
          ‘Christiaan Huygens', in cooperation with X (former Unit Sports &amp;
          Culture, TU Delft). All students are welcome to bring their PCs to
          play their favourite games with their friends. There will be official
          tournaments where you can win amazing prizes. Besides the official
          tournaments, you can team up and have fun with more casual games as
          well or organize your own tournament.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are no hardcore gamer, don’t worry. There are also enough
          offline-games to play with. Think about arcade cabinets, retro
          consoles and board games. More information about the event will be
          published at a later date.

      <h1>Official Tournaments</h1>
      <p>
        There are multiple official tournaments that will be organized by the
        committee. These tournaments feature large prize pools, so expect the
        competition to be fierce. If your favorite game is not listed here do
        not worry, you can organize your own! Contact us to get the ball
        rolling, more information on how to do that is found below.

      <h1>Organize your own Tournament</h1>
      <p>
        Is your favorite game not listed as an official tournament? We offer the
        possibility to host this tournament yourself. To set up your own
        tournament you need to write a proposal for your tournament. This
        proposal should contain the following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which game you want to host</li>
        <li>Game format (Free-for all, 5 vs 5, 1 vs 1, etc)</li>
        <li>
          Tournament structure (Qualifiers, rounds and a final, or a single
          round)
        </li>
        <li>Winner criteria (How is the winner chosen?)</li>
        <li>
          Expected duration (4 hours for the entire tournament, or does it span
          multiple days?)
        </li>
        <li>Required resources (Do you need our server, or host your own?)</li>
        <li>Contact information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="/contact">Send us an email</a> with all these details and we
        will get back to you!
      </p>
      <p>
        Please consider the official tournaments and their tight schedule when
        wanting to host a large tournament. We prefer short compact tournaments,
        but don't let that stop you from proposing an amazing multi-day event.
        There is no limit to the duration of the tournament, but the format
        should be considered. A truly competitive tournament should not take
        more than a morning or afternoon, while a casual long-term tournament
        can span multiple days.
      </p>
      <p>
        After we receive your proposal through the contact form, we will review
        it and hopefully accept it. When that happens, we appoint you as the
        responsible person to run the tournament. This means that entire
        organization of the tournament will be up to you. Our own support for
        the tournament will be minimal but we will help you gain other
        enthusiastic gamers by placing your tournament on our site for others to
        sign up. If you are interested in sponsoring one of the unofficial
        tournaments, you can find our contact information below.
